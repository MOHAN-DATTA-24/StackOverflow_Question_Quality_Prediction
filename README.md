# Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models for Stack Overflow Question Quality Classification


 <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Community question and answer (CQA) platforms like Stack Overflow are essential for both those seeking technological answers and those offering their expertise. Stack Overflow is especially renowned for coding tricks, development tools, software algorithms, and programming challenges. It serves as a dynamic knowledge base where solved solutions accumulate, answers to new questions are provided promptly, and user-contributed content adds immense exploratory value. Unlike static resources, Stack Overflow offers real-time updates and current information, allowing for discussions about specific programming libraries, operating systems, and software application versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, according to Roy et al., the quality of content on CQA platforms like Stack Overflow can be inconsistent. Hu et al. [7] note that poor-quality answers can negatively impact users' experiences. There is no guarantee that available solutions will be considered excellent. As per [10], the range of questions varies significantly, from "good" to "poor," indicating that some issues remain unresolved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stack Overflow aims to maintain high-quality content by removing or disabling offensive posts, yet the platform faces numerous challenges. These include managing vast amounts of content, identifying infidelity in posts, eliminating duplicate questions, and determining the best answers for queries. The sheer number of questions necessitates ranking them by quality and relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary objective of this study is to apply machine learning techniques to enhance the evaluation of Stack Overflow questions and accurately classify them into quality categories such as High Quality, Low Quality - Edit, and Low Quality. This research employs deep learning architectures like BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, and includes a comparative study.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

In today's digital environment, platforms like Stack Overflow are essential for developers seeking programming solutions. The quality of questions posted significantly affects user experience and the overall knowledge-sharing process. However, inconsistencies in question quality can lead to poor user experiences and reduce the platform's effectiveness.

This project addresses the challenge of accurately predicting the quality of questions on Stack Overflow. By leveraging advanced soft computing techniques such as BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, the goal is to categorize questions into three quality classes: High Quality, Low Quality - Edit, and Low Quality. Each model will be rigorously trained and evaluated, with accuracy serving as the primary performance metric.

The outcome of this research aims to provide a systematic approach to enhancing question quality, thereby preserving Stack Overflow's integrity and usefulness as a key resource for developers.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project is the Stack Overflow questions dataset found collected by Moore (Data scientist at Kertoft). This dataset can be found on Kaggle. The dataset consists of over 60,000 data samples that are collected from the Stack Overflow website. These questions were asked in a time period ranging from 2016 to 2020. The dataset consists of the unique question ID, a question title, main body or content of the question, tags representing the important words (keywords) in the question, creation date of the question as well as the class/label of the question. The label itself consists of three classes,<br>

1. **High-Quality (HQ)**, questions that receive a score a more than 30 from the community and is not edited a single time by anyone.<br>
2. **Low-Quality Edited (LQ_EDIT)**, questions that receive a negative score and multiple edits from the community.<br>
3. **Low-Quality Closed (LQ_CLOSE)**, questions that were immediately closed by the community due to its extremely poor quality. These questions are sorted according to their question ID. Also, the main content or text of the questions are in the HTML format and the dates are in the UTC format.<br>

<h2>Proposed Methodology</h2>

### Approach

Our approach for predicting the quality of Stack Overflow questions leverages transformer-based deep learning models. Transformers, grounded in self-attention mechanisms, are well-suited for language comprehension. We use pre-trained BERT and its variants, including DistilBERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, fine-tuned for our specific dataset.

### Architecture

![Proposed Architecture](Proposed%20Architecture.jpg)

- **BERT**: Utilizes a 12-layer transformer to generate embeddings. The last layer's [CLS] token embedding is used for classification.
- **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster version of BERT, retaining 97% of BERTâ€™s language understanding while being 60% quicker.
- **XLNet**: Employs permutation language modeling to capture bidirectional context and improve performance on various NLP tasks.
- **ALBERT**: An efficient version of BERT with fewer parameters, using techniques like SentencePiece tokenization and parameter sharing to enhance processing power.
- **RoBERTa**: A robustly optimized BERT model, trained longer and on more data, focusing on masked language modeling without next sentence prediction.
- **ELECTRA**: Introduces a token replacement strategy, training a discriminator to distinguish between original and replaced tokens for improved efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing

For this project, several preprocessing steps are performed to ensure the quality of the data used for training our models:

1. **ID Removal**: The question ID, being a unique identifier, is removed as it does not influence the quality of the question.

2. **Text Combination**: The title and body of the question are combined into a single string to provide a unified input for the model.

3. **Tag Removal**: Tags are omitted from the dataset since they do not affect the quality of the question.

4. **Date Removal**: The creation date of the question is excluded to prevent any potential bias related to temporal factors.

5. **HTML Tag Removal**: HTML tags are removed as they do not contribute semantic value to the text data.

6. **Text Tokenization**: The text data is tokenized and converted into sequences of integers, creating word embeddings with a set vocabulary and sequence limit.

7. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, the data is split into 75% training (45,000 samples), 25% validation (15,000 samples).

These preprocessing steps ensure that the data is clean, relevant, and suitable for training and evaluating our models.

<h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
The study confirms transformer-based models particularly BERT and ELECTRA with the accuracy of  87.5% and 87.4% respectively, They excel in predicting quality of Stack Overflow questions. Their ability to understand and classify textual data accurately supports maintaining high-quality content on CQA platforms.

Future work could focus on developing hybrid models that combine transformer models with traditional machine learning techniques. Implementing real-time quality assessment frameworks would be beneficial. Extending the methodologies to other CQA platforms to generalize findings should also be considered.
